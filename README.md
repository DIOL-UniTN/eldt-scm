# Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning for Interpretable Decision Making for the Supply Chain
In the context of Industry 4.0, Supply Chain Management (SCM) faces challenges in adopting advanced optimization techniques due to the "black-box" nature of AI-based solvers, which causes reluctance among company stakeholders. This work employs an Interpretable Artificial Intelligence (IAI) approach that combines evolutionary computation with reinforcement learning to generate interpretable decision-making policies in the form of decision trees (DT). This interpretable solver is embedded within a simulation-based optimization framework specifically designed to handle the inherent uncertainties and stochastic behaviors of modern supply chains. To our knowledge, this marks the first attempt to combine IAI solvers with simulation-based optimization for SCM decision-making. The methodology is tested on two supply chain optimization problems, one fictional and one from the real world, and its performance is compared against widely used algorithms. The results reveal that the interpretable approach delivers competitive, and sometimes better, performance, challenging the prevailing notion that there must be a trade-off between interpretability and optimization efficiency. Additionally, the developed framework demonstrates strong potential for industrial applications, offering seamless integration with various Python-based solvers.
